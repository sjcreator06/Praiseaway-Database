Reaches of heaven, starry heights
Lights of the evening dancing in silent skies
Brilliance of morning, breaking day
O let them praise Him, praise His name

O praise His name, O praise His name
Let all His wondrous works declare His praise

Mightiest mountains, peaceful plains
Snowfall and fire, thundering ocean waves
Kings and their kingdoms, age to age
O let them praise Him, praise His name

King enthroned in majesty, all things made by His decree
Hear creation’s melody, “Praise Him! Praise Him!”
Everything with life and breath, everywhere from east to west
Every heart raised from the dead, praise Him, praise Him
Angels echo the refrain, “Jesus, Lamb for sinners slain!”
Name above all other names, praise Him
