Once in the wilderness of our sin
We wandered lost and without hope
Into our desert waste God in grace
Came to restore and bring us home
Let the redeemed of God rise up and sing

We give thanks, O God, for Your steadfast love
We give thanks, O God, for You are good
Lord, You are good, we give thanks

Through every pain and trial, You provide
Light in the dark of our distress
Lifting us from on high when we cry
Turning our grief to gratefulness
Let the redeemed of God rise up and sing

You take the darkness and make it as light
Hearts that were dead in sin, You raise to life
You take a barren place and make it a spring
Let the redeemed of God rise up and sing
Let the redeemed of God rise up and sing!
